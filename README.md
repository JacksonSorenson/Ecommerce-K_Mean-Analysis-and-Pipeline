**Product Recommendation System Project**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on building a Product Recommendation System using e-commerce data that includes transaction details, product descriptions, and customer information. The system aims to analyze customer behavior and recommend products to enhance user experience and boost sales.

**Key Objectives**

Understand customer preferences: Analyze purchasing patterns to identify customer interests.

Improve user engagement: Develop a recommendation engine to suggest relevant products.

Increase sales: Use insights from the data to promote frequently purchased and related products.

**Project Files**

**1. Data Pipeline with Random Data (Notebook)**

This notebook demonstrates the initial steps for:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning and formatting raw e-commerce data.

Data augmentation: Simulating additional data points for robust analysis.

Pipeline construction: Ensuring scalability and modularity in data handling.

**2. K-Means Clustering and Analysis (Notebook)**

This notebook contains:

Clustering analysis: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.

Feature extraction: Identifying key traits of customer clusters.

Visualization: Representing clusters using plots for better interpretability.

**Tools and Technologies**

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning Techniques:

K-Means Clustering: Segment customers based on similar purchasing behaviors.

Recommendation Algorithms: Collaborative filtering and content-based methods.

**Analysis Summary**

**Key Insights from Clustering**

Customer Segments:

Clustering revealed distinct customer segments based on their spending patterns and product preferences.

These segments can be targeted for personalized marketing strategies.

Product Trends:

Popular products and frequently purchased combinations were identified.

Seasonal trends in purchasing behavior were observed, which can guide inventory planning.

Challenges Addressed

Data Imbalance: Handled with data augmentation techniques.

Scalability: Implemented modular pipelines for efficient processing of large datasets.

Cold Start Problem: Tackled by blending content-based filtering with collaborative filtering.

**Additional Notes**

Ran k-means clustering on e-commerce data to define customer segmentation.

Performed analysis and added feature engineering to the dataset.

Created a data pipeline that generates new random data and integrates it into the CSV file.
